A messenging app built as part of The App Brewery's iOS 11 course.

## Things learned:
- Firebase authentication and database
- how to use `UITableView` with a custom table view cell styled using a `.xib` file
- animations (animated the text field sliding up onfocus)
- using `UITapGestureRecognizer` add listener to UI elements to listen for tap gestures (tapping on the message table view collapses the text field)
